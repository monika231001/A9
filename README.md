# BuggyBrain: AI-Powered Car Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
BuggyBrain is an AI-powered car dashboard designed to provide **real-time assistance** and **intelligent mobility solutions** using **Raspberry Pi 4**. The system integrates **natural language processing (NLP), object detection, and adaptive learning** to enhance safety, convenience, and user experience.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI Virtual Assistant** – Responds to user queries and controls car functionalities.
- **Real-Time Location Updates** – Provides vehicle location within a closed environment (e.g., college campus).
- **Obstacle Detection & Safety Alerts** – Identifies objects, humans, or obstacles in real-time.
- **Energy Optimization** – Offers battery life management and charging recommendations.
- **Navigation Assistance** – Updates on real-time traffic and nearby charging stations.
- **Predictive Maintenance** – Alerts users about potential vehicle issues before they occur.
- **Personalized Assistance** – Learns user behavior to optimize responses and actions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **AI & ML:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), YOLO for object detection
